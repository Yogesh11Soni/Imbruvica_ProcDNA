Reducing prices for drugs like Eliquis, Jardiance, Xarelto, Januvia, Farxiga, Entresto, Enbrel, Imbruvica, Stelara, and Fiasp is indeed commendable.  📊 Who does this impact?   This move is estimated to benefit approximately 10-20% of the American population. These medications are key for people with various conditions, ranging from heart diseases and diabetes to certain types of cancer.  🤔 But why stop there?  📈 We propose extending this initiative to include more life-essential drugs:  Metformin, Atorvastatin, Lisinopril, Levothyroxine, Amlodipine, Albuterol, Hydrochlorothiazide, Ibuprofen, Gabapentin, Sertraline  🎯 Target Impact?   By doing this, the government could make a significant difference for an estimated 30-50% of the American population, addressing a variety of pervasive health conditions from hypertension and asthma to depression.  🌐 The Bigger Picture: Let’s not just create a ripple; let’s make a wave.
